# Zero Operator Access (ZOA) — Security Model

**Last Updated Date**: 2026-06-10

## Summary

This document details the security architecture for ZOA Trusted Actions: how privileges are scoped, how isolation is enforced between executions, how audit trails are constructed, and what alternatives were evaluated for ServiceAccount isolation.

## Threat Model

### Threats Mitigated

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Operator runs arbitrary commands on MC | Only pre-defined TAs can be executed — no shell access, no kubectl proxy |
| Operator accesses secrets/data beyond their need | Per-execution RBAC limits access to exactly what the TA declares |
| Operator acts without attribution | Every execution records caller identity (ARN, account, operator name) |
| Compromised TA escalates privileges | TA script runs with scoped Role, cannot self-modify SA or create privileged resources |
| Stale credentials persist | No long-lived kubeconfigs — all access is ephemeral (Job exits → resources deleted) |
| S3 output exfiltrated | Bucket is encrypted (SSE-KMS), no presigned URLs exposed, API proxies content |
| Log tampering | S3 versioning enabled, lifecycle prevents deletion before 365 days |

### Trust Boundaries

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Trust Zone A: Operator workstation       │
│  - SigV4 credentials (STS, time-limited)│
│  - Cannot reach MC/RC directly           │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                     │ HTTPS + SigV4
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Trust Zone B: Regional Cluster (RC)      │
│  - Platform API (validates, dispatches) │
│  - Maestro Server (stores, distributes) │
│  - DynamoDB + S3 (persists)             │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                     │ MQTT (encrypted)
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Trust Zone C: Management Cluster (MC)    │
│  - Maestro Agent (applies manifests)    │
│  - zoa-jobs namespace (executes TAs)    │
│  - Control plane namespaces (HCPs)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The ZOA system operates at the boundary between Zone B and Zone C. Platform API (Zone B) generates RBAC but cannot enforce it — Kubernetes API server on MC (Zone C) enforces RBAC at runtime.

## Identity and Authentication

### Caller Identity Chain

```
AWS STS → Temporary Credentials → SigV4 Signature → API Gateway → Platform API
```

Platform API extracts from the SigV4-authenticated request:

| Field | Source | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `account_id` | API Gateway context | `123456789012` |
| `caller_arn` | API Gateway context | `arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/DevAccess/slopezma` |
| `operator` | Parsed from ARN session name | `slopezma` |

These are recorded with every execution — no way to execute a TA without identity.

### No Shared Credentials

- Operators use their own AWS credentials (not a shared service account)
- Credentials are STS temporary tokens with configurable session duration
- API Gateway validates the signature cryptographically — no token forwarding

## RBAC Model

### Per-Execution RBAC (Dynamic)

Every TA execution creates its own Role/ClusterRole + Binding on the MC:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: zoa-<execution-id>
  namespace: maestro
  labels:
    zoa.rosa.io/execution-id: "fa65418c-..."
    zoa.rosa.io/action: "get_pods"
    zoa.rosa.io/managed: "true"
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: zoa-<execution-id>
  namespace: maestro
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: zoa-kube-sa
    namespace: zoa-jobs
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: zoa-<execution-id>
```

**Key properties:**

- RBAC resources are scoped to exactly what the TA declares — nothing more
- RoleBindings bind the per-execution runner SA
- All RBAC resources are deleted when the reconciler cleans up the ResourceBundle
- Namespace-scoped Roles for namespace-specific TAs, ClusterRoles for cluster-wide TAs

### ServiceAccount Model (Two-Job Architecture)

ZOA uses a split SA model for privilege separation:

| SA | Lifecycle | Kubernetes Access | AWS Access |
|----|-----------|------------------|------------|
| `zoa-runner-<exec-id>` | Per-execution (dynamic) | Per-execution Role only | **None** |
| `zoa-uploader` | Static (infra) | ConfigMap read in `zoa-jobs` | `s3:PutObject` + `kms:Encrypt` |
| `zoa-aws-read` | Static (infra) | Per-execution Role | AWS read-only APIs (no S3 on ZOA bucket) |
| `zoa-aws-write` | Static (infra) | Per-execution Role | AWS read-write APIs (no S3 on ZOA bucket) |

**Key design decisions:**

1. **Per-execution SA for kube TAs**: `zoa-runner-<exec-id>` is created dynamically as part of the ManifestWork. It has no Pod Identity (no AWS IAM role). This gives perfect K8s audit-log attribution.
2. **Static SAs for AWS TAs**: `zoa-aws-read` and `zoa-aws-write` require pre-provisioned Pod Identity associations. These are static but still have **no access to the ZOA S3 bucket**.
3. **Dedicated uploader SA**: Only `zoa-uploader` can write to S3. This completely separates operational permissions from output transport.
4. **No SA has both**: No single SA has both operational permissions AND S3 write access.

## Secrets Protection

### Multi-Layer Defense

ZOA has multiple safeguards preventing Trusted Actions from accessing Kubernetes Secrets:

#### Layer 1: TA Template RBAC (Compile-Time)

TA authors declare exactly which resources they need. The `get_secrets` TA would need:

```yaml
rbac:
  rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["secrets"]
      verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

This is visible in code review. Any new TA or RBAC change requires PR approval.

#### Layer 2: Platform API Validation (Runtime)

Platform API can enforce additional constraints:

- Deny-list certain resources (e.g., reject any TA requesting `secrets` access)
- Require elevated approval for sensitive resources
- Block specific namespaces (HCP control plane namespaces)

#### Layer 3: Runner SA Isolation (Two-Job Architecture)

Even if a Role grants `secrets` access, the runner SA has no AWS credentials at all:

- `zoa-runner-<exec-id>` has zero AWS IAM permissions — it cannot exfiltrate to any AWS destination
- Only `zoa-uploader` has S3 access, and it only reads from the output ConfigMap (not from the cluster)
- Kubernetes NetworkPolicy restricts egress from `zoa-jobs` namespace

#### Layer 4: Audit and Detection

Any attempt to access secrets would be:

- Recorded in Kubernetes audit logs (SA + pod labels identify the execution)
- Correlated to the operator via DynamoDB execution record
- Detectable via audit log alerting rules

### Current Policy: No Secrets TA Until Approval Workflow

The `get_secrets` TA is deferred until an approval workflow is implemented. When it's enabled:

- Requires peer approval before dispatch
- Outputs only secret metadata (keys, not values) by default
- Full values require additional elevation with time-limited grant

## S3 Output Security

### Encryption

- **At rest**: SSE-KMS with a dedicated ZOA KMS key
- **In transit**: HTTPS (TLS 1.2+ enforced by bucket policy)
- **Key policy**: Only the ZOA job role and Platform API role can use the key

### Access Control

```
Bucket Policy:
  - Principal: zoa-job-role → Action: s3:PutObject (write only, no read/delete)
  - Principal: platform-api-role → Action: s3:GetObject (read only, no write/delete)
  - Deny all other principals
  - Deny non-TLS connections (aws:SecureTransport=false)
```

### No Direct Consumer Access

The API proxies S3 content — consumers never receive presigned URLs or direct bucket access. This means:

- No URL sharing/leakage risk
- Access is always authenticated and logged
- Platform API can enforce additional authorization checks

### Object Metadata for Audit

Every S3 object carries metadata headers:

```
x-amz-meta-execution-id: fa65418c-...
x-amz-meta-operator: slopezma
x-amz-meta-action: get_pods
x-amz-meta-target: mc-useast1-1
```

## Audit Trail Completeness

### What's Recorded Where

| Event | Storage | Retention | Query |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|
| TA execution requested | DynamoDB | Indefinite | `zoa runs` |
| Full execution log | S3 | 365 days | `zoa logs <id>` |
| Structured output | S3 | 365 days | `zoa get <id>` |
| API Gateway access | CloudTrail | 90 days (configurable) | AWS Console |
| Kubernetes API calls from Job | MC audit log | Cluster-dependent | kubectl audit |
| ResourceBundle lifecycle | Maestro server logs | Log retention | kubectl logs |

### Correlation Keys

All layers use `execution-id` as the primary correlation key:

```
CloudTrail → API Gateway request with execution-id in response
DynamoDB → execution record with full metadata
S3 → objects keyed by execution-id
MC K8s resources → labels with zoa.rosa.io/execution-id
MC audit logs → SA + pod labels map to execution-id
```

### Immutability

- DynamoDB: No `DeleteItem` permissions for Platform API role (update-only)
- S3: Versioning enabled, lifecycle prevents deletion before 365 days
- K8s audit logs: Cluster-level, not modifiable by workloads

## Two-Job Architecture: Design Rationale

### Motivation

The two-job architecture was adopted based on team feedback:

1. **SA isolation**: Runner SAs carry only Kubernetes RBAC permissions — no AWS credentials for S3
2. **Reduced blast radius**: A compromised TA script cannot exfiltrate to S3
3. **Perfect K8s audit attribution**: Per-execution SAs (`zoa-runner-<exec-id>`) identify exactly which execution performed each K8s action
4. **Clear separation of concerns**: Operational actions (runner) vs. output transport (uploader) are distinct

### Architecture

```
ManifestWork contains:
  ├── ServiceAccount: zoa-runner-<exec-id> (per-execution, no AWS)
  ├── Role/ClusterRole (per-execution RBAC for TA)
  ├── RoleBinding → zoa-runner-<exec-id>
  ├── ConfigMap: zoa-output-<exec-id> (empty, output transfer)
  ├── Role: zoa-output-<exec-id> (allows runner to patch output CM)
  ├── RoleBinding → zoa-runner-<exec-id>
  ├── ConfigMap: zoa-scripts-<exec-id> (entrypoint.sh + run.sh)
  │
  ├── Runner Job: zoa-<exec-id>
  │     ServiceAccount: zoa-runner-<exec-id> (dynamic, no Pod Identity)
  │     Volumes: scripts ConfigMap, EmptyDir (/artifacts)
  │     On completion: patches output ConfigMap with results
  │
  └── Uploader Job: zoa-<exec-id>-upload
        ServiceAccount: zoa-uploader (static, Pod Identity: s3:PutObject only)
        Waits for runner Job to complete, reads output CM, uploads to S3
```

### Properties

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **SA for TA script** | `zoa-runner-<exec-id>` (per-execution, no AWS creds) |
| **SA for S3 upload** | `zoa-uploader` (static, Pod Identity, no kube RBAC beyond CM read) |
| **AWS creds in TA Job** | No — dynamic SA has no Pod Identity |
| **K8s audit attribution** | Per-execution (e.g., `zoa-runner-fa65418c`) |
| **Resource count per execution** | ~9 (SA, RBAC, output CM, output RBAC, scripts CM, runner Job, upload Job) |
| **Output size limit** | 1MB (ConfigMap limit for inter-job transfer) |
| **Latency overhead** | +3-10s (uploader waits for runner completion + S3 upload) |
| **IAM associations** | 1 uploader SA per MC (static, pre-provisioned via Terraform) |

### Known Constraints

**1MB ConfigMap limit**: Output transferred via ConfigMap is limited to ~1MB. For all current read TAs (get_pods, get_nodes, etc.) output is well under this. If larger output is needed in the future, alternatives include:

- Shared PVC between Jobs (eliminates size limit but adds provisioning)
- Runner direct S3 upload for specific large-output TAs (breaks isolation but pragmatic)

**Uploader SA is static**: All upload operations share one SA (`zoa-uploader`). This is acceptable because:

- S3 uploads are write-only (no read access to existing artifacts)
- The execution ID in the S3 key path provides attribution
- DynamoDB records which execution produced which output

## FIPS Compliance

| Component | FIPS Control |
|-----------|-------------|
| S3 encryption | SSE-KMS with FIPS-validated KMS endpoint |
| TLS | FIPS-validated TLS libraries in RHEL UBI9 base image |
| AWS CLI in job | Uses FIPS endpoints when `AWS_USE_FIPS_ENDPOINT=true` |
| DynamoDB | FIPS endpoint via VPC Gateway Endpoint |
| MQTT (Maestro) | TLS 1.2+ with FIPS-validated cipher suites |

## Network Security

### zoa-jobs Namespace Policies

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: zoa-jobs-egress
  namespace: zoa-jobs
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes: [Egress]
  egress:
    # Allow: Kubernetes API (for kubectl commands)
    - to:
        - ipBlock: { cidr: <kube-api-cidr>/32 }
      ports:
        - port: 443
          protocol: TCP
    # Allow: S3 and KMS via VPC endpoints
    - to:
        - ipBlock: { cidr: <vpc-endpoint-cidr> }
      ports:
        - port: 443
          protocol: TCP
    # Allow: DNS
    - to: []
      ports:
        - port: 53
          protocol: UDP
        - port: 53
          protocol: TCP
```

**Denied by default:**

- No internet egress (no arbitrary HTTP calls from TA scripts)
- No lateral movement to other namespaces
- No access to node metadata service (IMDS blocked)
